# KuruSwap Isolated

This is an isolated version of the KuruSwap swap functionality from the monad-testnet-auto project.

## Structure

- `swap.js`: Main swap functionality
- `ABI.js`: Contract ABIs and addresses
- `scripts/apis.js`: API functions for interacting with KuruSwap
- `utils/chain.js`: Chain configuration

## Usage

To use the swap functionality:

```bash
node swap.js
```

This will start the interactive swap process where you can select tokens and amounts to swap.
